This software was developed with support from FSF.hu Foundation, Hungary.

Introduction: http://libreoffice.hu/2011/12/08/grammar-checking-in-libreoffice/

== Installation ==

1. Via Tools -> Extension manager in OOo/LibreOffice

2. or with unopkg tool, for example

[install_path\program\]unopkg add -f lightproof_editor-0.1.oxt

== Usage ==

Note: there is a huge starting time (seconds) starting LibreOffice with the
Lightproof editor. [Removing the unnecessary locales from src/editor/editor.cfg
of Lightproof source and generating a new editor extension can solve this problem.]

The Lightproof editor extension contains a special grammar checker component and
a LibreOffice Writer toolbar. The editor can update its grammar checker component based
on the Lightproof rules in the current Writer document.

Note: for languages without 'official LibreOffice' Hunspell dictionaries or languages
with default LibreOffice grammar checking (English, Russian and Hungarian in LibO 3.5)
have to modify some settings, too, see doc/manual.txt in the zipped extension, or you
can choose a neutral language (eg. Esperanto) for your Writer document during the rule
development. Only the Hunspell-related Lightproof functions, eg. spell(), morph() need
the correct language.

After the successful installation (and settings), you can check the work of the grammar
checking component of the editor with the following text:

a a

The repeating letters will be underlined with blue wavy line (thanks to the default
a a -> a # Did you mean
rule of the grammar checker component of the editor).

Write the following Lightproof rule in an empty Writer document:

b b -> b # suggestion

Click on the first icon on the Lightproof editor toolbar. The 'b b' text will be
underlined with blue wavy line as a grammar mistake with the 'b' suggestion and
'suggestion' explanation. 

Load and modify the English Lightproof rules (src/en/en.dat) or decribe new rules
based on doc/syntax.txt (these files can be found in the oxt (zipped) file of the
Lightproof editor extension, too). See also doc/manual.txt and
http://libreoffice.hu/2011/12/08/grammar-checking-in-libreoffice/

= Toolbar icons =

1. Apply rules

editor grammar checker component.

2. Apply all rules
